Animate between UI states using the browser's native `document.startViewTransition`. Declare *what* with `<ViewTransition>`, trigger *when* with `startTransition` / `useDeferredValue` / `Suspense`, control *how* with CSS classes. Unsupported browsers skip animations gracefully.

## When to Animate

Every `<ViewTransition>` should communicate a spatial relationship or continuity. If you can't articulate what it communicates, don't add it.

Implement **all** applicable patterns from this list, in this order:

| Priority | Pattern | What it communicates |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Shared element** (`name`) | "Same thing — going deeper" |
| 2 | **Suspense reveal** | "Data loaded" |
| 3 | **List identity** (per-item `key`) | "Same items, new arrangement" |
| 4 | **State change** (`enter`/`exit`) | "Something appeared/disappeared" |
| 5 | **Route change** (layout-level) | "Going to a new place" |

This is an implementation order, not a "pick one" list. Implement every pattern that fits the app. Only skip a pattern if the app has no use case for it.

### Choosing Animation Style

| Context | Animation | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Hierarchical navigation (list → detail) | Type-keyed `nav-forward` / `nav-back` | Communicates spatial depth |
| Lateral navigation (tab-to-tab) | Bare `<ViewTransition>` (fade) or `default="none"` | No depth to communicate |
| Suspense reveal | `enter`/`exit` string props | Content arriving |
| Revalidation / background refresh | `default="none"` | Silent — no animation needed |

Reserve directional slides for hierarchical navigation (list → detail) and ordered sequences (prev/next photo, carousel, paginated results). For ordered sequences, the direction communicates position: "next" slides from right, "previous" from left. Lateral/unordered navigation (tab-to-tab) should not use directional slides — it falsely implies spatial depth.

---

## Availability

- **Next.js:** Do **not** install `react@canary` — the App Router already bundles React canary internally. `ViewTransition` works out of the box. `npm ls react` may show a stable-looking version; this is expected.
- **Without Next.js:** Install `react@canary react-dom@canary` (`ViewTransition` is not in stable React).
- Browser support: Chromium 125+, Firefox 144+, Safari 18.2+. React requires the v2 object form of `startViewTransition` and deliberately falls back to not animating on older engines (Chromium 111–124 only has the v1 callback form). Graceful degradation on unsupported browsers.

---

## Implementation Workflow

When adding view transitions to an existing app, **follow the Implementation Workflow section below step by step.** Start with the audit — do not skip it. Copy the CSS recipes from the CSS Animation Recipes section below into the global stylesheet — do not write your own animation CSS.

---

## Core Concepts

### The `<ViewTransition>` Component

```jsx
import { ViewTransition } from 'react';

<ViewTransition>
  <Component />
</ViewTransition>
```

React auto-assigns a unique `view-transition-name` and calls `document.startViewTransition` behind the scenes. Never call `startViewTransition` yourself.

### Animation Triggers

| Trigger | When it fires |
|---------|--------------|
| **enter** | `<ViewTransition>` first inserted during a Transition |
| **exit** | `<ViewTransition>` first removed during a Transition |
| **update** | DOM mutations inside a `<ViewTransition>`, or the boundary itself changing size/position due to an immediate sibling. With nested VTs, mutation applies to the innermost one |
| **share** | Named VT unmounts and another with same `name` mounts in the same Transition |

Only `startTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, or `Suspense` activate VTs. Regular `setState` does not animate.

### Critical Placement Rule

`<ViewTransition>` only activates enter/exit if it appears **before any DOM nodes**:

```jsx
// Works
<ViewTransition enter="auto" exit="auto">
  <div>Content</div>
</ViewTransition>

// Broken — div wraps the VT, suppressing enter/exit
<div>
  <ViewTransition enter="auto" exit="auto">
    <div>Content</div>
  </ViewTransition>
</div>
```

---

## Styling with View Transition Classes

### Props

Values: `"auto"` (browser cross-fade), `"none"` (disabled), `"class-name"` (custom CSS), or `{ [type]: value }` for type-specific animations.

```jsx
<ViewTransition default="none" enter="slide-in" exit="slide-out" share="morph" />
```

If `default` is `"none"`, all triggers are off unless explicitly listed.

### CSS Pseudo-Elements

- `::view-transition-old(.class)` — outgoing snapshot
- `::view-transition-new(.class)` — incoming snapshot
- `::view-transition-group(.class)` — container
- `::view-transition-image-pair(.class)` — old + new pair

See the CSS Animation Recipes section below for ready-to-use animation recipes.

---

## Transition Types

Tag transitions with `addTransitionType` so VTs can pick different animations based on context. Call it multiple times to stack types — different VTs in the tree react to different types:

```jsx
startTransition(() => {
  addTransitionType('nav-forward');
  addTransitionType('select-item');
  router.push('/detail/1');
});
```

Pass an object to map types to CSS classes. Works on `enter`, `exit`, **and** `share`:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{ 'nav-forward': 'slide-from-right', 'nav-back': 'slide-from-left', default: 'none' }}
  exit={{ 'nav-forward': 'slide-to-left', 'nav-back': 'slide-to-right', default: 'none' }}
  share={{ 'nav-forward': 'morph-forward', 'nav-back': 'morph-back', default: 'morph' }}
  default="none"
>
  <Page />
</ViewTransition>
```

`enter` and `exit` don't have to be symmetric. For example, fade in but slide out directionally:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{ 'nav-forward': 'fade-in', 'nav-back': 'fade-in', default: 'none' }}
  exit={{ 'nav-forward': 'nav-forward', 'nav-back': 'nav-back', default: 'none' }}
  default="none"
>
```

**TypeScript:** `ViewTransitionClassPerType` requires a `default` key in the object.

For apps with multiple pages, extract the type-keyed VT into a reusable wrapper:

```jsx
export function DirectionalTransition({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ViewTransition
      enter={{ 'nav-forward': 'nav-forward', 'nav-back': 'nav-back', default: 'none' }}
      exit={{ 'nav-forward': 'nav-forward', 'nav-back': 'nav-back', default: 'none' }}
      default="none"
    >
      {children}
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

### `router.back()` and Browser Back Button

`router.back()` and the browser's back/forward buttons do **not** animate: React renders transitions scheduled during a `popstate` event synchronously (`shouldAttemptEagerTransition`) to keep back/forward instant, and synchronous renders skip view transitions. Traversals also carry no transition types, so type-keyed maps resolve to their `default`. Use `router.push()` with an explicit URL instead.

### Types and Suspense

Types are available during navigation but **not** during subsequent Suspense reveals (separate transitions, no type). Use type maps for page-level enter/exit; use simple string props for Suspense reveals.

---

## Shared Element Transitions

Same `name` on two VTs — one unmounting, one mounting — creates a shared element morph:

```jsx
<ViewTransition name="hero-image">
  <img src="/thumb.jpg" onClick={() => startTransition(() => onSelect())} />
</ViewTransition>

// On the other view — same name
<ViewTransition name="hero-image">
  <img src="/full.jpg" />
</ViewTransition>
```

- Only one VT with a given `name` can be mounted at a time — use unique names (`photo-${id}`). Watch for reusable components: if a component with a named VT is rendered in both a modal/popover *and* a page, both mount simultaneously and break the morph. Either make the name conditional (via a prop) or move the named VT out of the shared component into the specific consumer.
- `share` takes precedence over `enter`/`exit`. Think through each navigation path: when no matching pair forms (e.g., the target page doesn't have the same name), `enter`/`exit` fires instead. Consider whether the element needs a fallback animation for those paths.
- Two ways a wired-up morph silently never fires: (1) `default="none"` with no explicit `share` prop — share resolves to none; (2) type-keyed `share` where the navigation never adds the type — a plain link click resolves the map's `default`. Every link that should morph must add the type (`transitionTypes` on `next/link`, or `addTransitionType`).
- Never use a fade-out exit on pages with shared morphs — use a directional slide instead.

---

## Common Patterns

### Enter/Exit

```jsx
{show && (
  <ViewTransition enter="fade-in" exit="fade-out"><Panel /></ViewTransition>
)}
```

### List Reorder

```jsx
{items.map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id}><ItemCard item={item} /></ViewTransition>
))}
```

Trigger inside `startTransition`. Avoid wrapper `<div>`s between list and VT.

### Layout Displacement Morph

Only content inside an activated boundary animates position — everything else teleports to its new layout spot. Wrap the sibling content below a growing/shrinking list in a bare `<ViewTransition>` so it glides instead of jumping. See the Patterns and Guidelines section below → Layout Displacement Morph.

### Composing Shared Elements with List Identity

Shared elements and list identity are independent concerns — don't confuse one for the other. When a list item contains a shared element (e.g., an image that morphs into a detail view), use two nested `<ViewTransition>` boundaries:

```jsx
{items.map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id}>                                      {/* list identity */}
    <Link href={`/items/${item.id}`}>
      <ViewTransition name={`item-image-${item.id}`} share="morph">   {/* shared element */}
        <Image src={item.image} />
      </ViewTransition>
      <p>{item.name}</p>
    </Link>
  </ViewTransition>
))}
```

The outer VT handles list reorder/enter animations. The inner VT handles the cross-route shared element morph. Missing either layer means that animation silently doesn't happen.

### Force Re-Enter with `key`

```jsx
<ViewTransition key={searchParams.toString()} enter="slide-up" default="none">
  <ResultsGrid />
</ViewTransition>
```

**Caution:** If wrapping `<Suspense>`, changing `key` remounts the boundary and refetches.

### Suspense Fallback to Content

Simple cross-fade:
```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}><Content /></Suspense>
</ViewTransition>
```

Directional reveal:
```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<ViewTransition exit="slide-down"><Skeleton /></ViewTransition>}>
  <ViewTransition enter="slide-up" default="none"><Content /></ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

For more patterns, see the Patterns and Guidelines section below.

---

## How Multiple VTs Interact

Every VT matching the trigger fires simultaneously in a single `document.startViewTransition`. VTs in **different** transitions (navigation vs later Suspense resolve) don't compete.

### Use `default="none"` Deliberately

Without it, every VT fires the browser cross-fade on **every** transition — Suspense resolves, `useDeferredValue` updates, background revalidations. Use `default="none"` on named/shared elements and type-keyed page VTs.

But know what it turns off: `default="none"` also disables `update` (layout displacement morphs — list reflow, sections gliding when content above changes) and `share` (a named pair with `default="none"` and no explicit `share` prop silently never morphs). Keyed list items and displaced siblings *want* update — leave them bare or set `update="auto"` explicitly.

### Two Patterns Coexist

**Pattern A — Directional slides:** Type-keyed VT on each page, fires during navigation.
**Pattern B — Suspense reveals:** Simple string props, fires when data loads (no type).

They coexist because they fire at different moments. `default="none"` on both prevents cross-interference. Always pair `enter` with `exit`. Place directional VTs in page components, not layouts.

### Nested VT Limitation

When a parent VT mounts/unmounts **as one unit** with nested VTs inside it, the nested ones do not fire their own enter/exit — only the outermost VT animates. (A child VT mounted inside a *persistent* parent VT fires enter/exit normally.) Per-item staggered animations during page navigation are not possible today; the experimental opt-in is the `parentEnter`/`parentExit` props ([react#36690](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/36690), experimental channel only).

## Next.js Integration

For Next.js setup (`experimental.viewTransition` flag, `transitionTypes` prop on `next/link`, App Router patterns, Server Components), see the View Transitions in Next.js section below.

## Accessibility

Always add the reduced motion CSS from the CSS Animation Recipes section below to your global stylesheet.

# Implementation Workflow

Follow these steps in order when adding view transitions to an app. Each step builds on the previous one.

## Step 1: Audit the App

Before writing any code, scan the codebase thoroughly. Search for:

- **Every `<Link>` and `router.push`** — these are your navigation triggers. Open every file that contains one.
- **Every `<Suspense>` boundary** — each one is a candidate for a reveal animation. Check what its fallback renders.
- **Every page/route component** — list them all. Each page needs a VT placement decision.
- **Persistent elements** — headers, navbars, sidebars, sticky controls that stay on screen across navigations. These need `viewTransitionName` isolation.
- **Shared visual elements** — images, cards, or avatars that appear on both a source and target view (e.g., a thumbnail in a list and the same image on a detail page).
- **Skeleton-to-content control pairs** — if a Suspense fallback renders a control (search input, tab bar) that also exists in the real content, both need a matching `viewTransitionName`.

Then classify every navigation and produce a navigation map:

```
| Route           | Navigates to         | Direction    | VT pattern            |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| /               | /detail/[id]         | forward      | directional slide     |
| /detail/[id]    | /                    | back         | directional slide     |
| /detail/[id]    | /detail/[other]      | sequential   | directional slide (ordered prev/next) or key+share crossfade |
| /tab/[a]        | /tab/[b]             | lateral      | key+share crossfade   |
| (Suspense)      | (content loads)      | —            | slide-up reveal       |
```

For each shared element (`name` prop), note every navigation where a pair forms and where it doesn't — this determines whether you need `enter`/`exit` as a fallback alongside `share`.

## Step 2: Add CSS Recipes

Copy the **complete** CSS recipe set from the CSS Animation Recipes section into your global stylesheet. This includes timing variables, shared keyframes, fade, slide (vertical), directional navigation (forward/back), shared element morph, persistent element isolation, and reduced motion.

Do not write your own animation CSS — the recipes handle staggered timing, motion blur on morphs, and reduced motion that are easy to get wrong. You can customize timing variables (`--duration-exit`, `--duration-enter`, `--duration-move`) after the initial setup.

## Step 3: Isolate Persistent Elements

For every persistent element identified in Step 1, add a `viewTransitionName` style to pull it out of the page content's transition snapshot:

```jsx
<header style={{ viewTransitionName: "site-header" }}>...</header>
```

Then add the persistent element isolation CSS from the CSS Animation Recipes section (prevents the element from animating during page transitions). If the element uses `backdrop-blur` or `backdrop-filter`, use the backdrop-blur workaround from the CSS Animation Recipes section instead.

If a Suspense fallback mirrors a persistent control (e.g., a skeleton search input), give both the real control and the skeleton the same `viewTransitionName` so they morph in place.

## Step 4: Add Directional Page Transitions

For hierarchical navigations identified in Step 1, tag the navigation direction using `addTransitionType` inside `startTransition`:

```jsx
startTransition(() => {
  addTransitionType('nav-forward');
  router.push('/detail/1');
});
```

Then wrap each **page component** (not layout) in a type-keyed `<ViewTransition>`:

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{
    "nav-forward": "nav-forward",
    "nav-back": "nav-back",
    default: "none",
  }}
  exit={{
    "nav-forward": "nav-forward",
    "nav-back": "nav-back",
    default: "none",
  }}
  default="none"
>
  <div>...page content...</div>
</ViewTransition>
```

The `nav-forward` and `nav-back` CSS classes from the CSS Animation Recipes section produce horizontal slides. For simpler apps where directional motion isn't needed, a bare `<ViewTransition default="none">` wrapper with `enter="fade-in"` / `exit="fade-out"` works too.

Extract this into a reusable component so every page doesn't repeat the verbose type map:

```jsx
export function DirectionalTransition({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ViewTransition
      enter={{ 'nav-forward': 'nav-forward', 'nav-back': 'nav-back', default: 'none' }}
      exit={{ 'nav-forward': 'nav-forward', 'nav-back': 'nav-back', default: 'none' }}
      default="none"
    >
      {children}
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}
```

This also becomes the single place to adjust if you add new transition types later.

**Rules:**
- Always pair `enter` with `exit` — without an exit animation, the old page disappears instantly while the new one animates in.
- Always include `default: "none"` in type map objects and `default="none"` on the component — otherwise it fires on every transition.
- Place the directional `<ViewTransition>` in each page component, not in a layout. Layouts persist across navigations and never trigger enter/exit.
- Only use directional slides for hierarchical navigation or ordered sequences (prev/next). Lateral/sibling navigation (tab-to-tab) should use a bare `<ViewTransition>` (cross-fade) or `default="none"`.

## Step 5: Add Suspense Reveals

For every `<Suspense>` boundary identified in Step 1, wrap the fallback and content in separate `<ViewTransition>`s:

```jsx
<Suspense
  fallback={
    <ViewTransition exit="slide-down">
      <Skeleton />
    </ViewTransition>
  }
>
  <ViewTransition enter="slide-up" default="none">
    <AsyncContent />
  </ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

This example uses `slide-down` / `slide-up` for directional vertical motion. For a simpler reveal, a bare `<ViewTransition>` around the `<Suspense>` gives a cross-fade with zero configuration. Choose based on the spatial meaning — consult the "Choosing the Right Animation Style" table in the main skill file.

**Rules:**
- Always use `default="none"` on the content `<ViewTransition>` to prevent re-animation on revalidation or unrelated transitions.
- Use simple string props (not type maps) on Suspense `<ViewTransition>`s — Suspense resolves fire as separate transitions with no type, so type-keyed props won't match.
- If the same element appears in **both** the fallback and the content (a title, a heading), it flickers on reveal — an opacity dip. Render it **outside** the `<Suspense>` boundary (or pin it), so it isn't in both. See "Suspense reveal flicker" in the Patterns and Guidelines section.

## Step 6: Add Shared Element Transitions

For every shared visual element identified in Step 1, add matching named `<ViewTransition>` wrappers on both the source and target views:

```jsx
// On the source view (e.g., list/grid page)
<ViewTransition name={`photo-${photo.id}`} share="morph" default="none">
  <Image src={photo.src} ... />
</ViewTransition>

// On the target view (e.g., detail page) — same name
<ViewTransition name={`photo-${photo.id}`} share="morph">
  <Image src={photo.src} ... />
</ViewTransition>
```

The `share="morph"` class uses the morph recipe from the CSS Animation Recipes section (controlled duration + motion blur). For a simpler cross-fade, use `share="auto"` (browser default).

When list items contain shared elements, compose both patterns with two nested `<ViewTransition>` layers — see "Composing Shared Elements with List Identity" in `SKILL.md`.

**Rules:**
- Names must be globally unique — use prefixes like `photo-${id}`.
- Add `default="none"` on list-side shared elements to prevent per-item cross-fades on filter/search updates.
- The target must be **in the DOM at navigation time** for the pair to form. If it's behind a Suspense fallback (not rendered yet), no pair forms and it won't morph. It works when the target is present at the snapshot — render it above the data boundary, or have its data **cached/prefetched** so it resolves in time.

## Step 7: Verify Each Navigation Path

Walk through every row in the navigation map from Step 1 and confirm:

- Does the VT mount/unmount on this navigation, or does it stay mounted (same-route)?
- For named VTs: does a shared pair form? If not, does `enter`/`exit` provide a fallback?
- Does `default="none"` block an animation you actually want?
- Do persistent elements stay static (not sliding with page content)?
- Do Suspense reveals animate independently from directional navigations?

If any path produces no animation or competing animations, revisit the relevant step.

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Bare `<ViewTransition>` without props** — without `default="none"`, it fires the browser's default cross-fade on every transition (every navigation, every Suspense resolve, every revalidation). Always set `default="none"` and explicitly enable only the triggers you want.
- **Directional `<ViewTransition>` in a layout** — layouts persist across navigations and never unmount/remount. `enter`/`exit` props won't fire on route changes. Place the outer type-keyed `<ViewTransition>` in each page component.
- **Fade-out exit with shared element morphs** — the page dissolving conflicts with the morph. Use a directional slide exit instead.
- **Writing custom animation CSS** — the recipes in the CSS Animation Recipes section handle staggered timing, motion blur on morphs, and reduced motion. Copy them; don't reinvent them.
- **Missing `default: "none"` in type-keyed objects** — TypeScript requires a `default` key, and without it the fallback is `"auto"` which fires on every transition.
- **Type maps on Suspense reveals** — Suspense resolves fire as separate transitions with no type. Type-keyed props won't match — use simple string props instead.
- **Raw `viewTransitionName` CSS to trigger animations** — React only calls `document.startViewTransition` when `<ViewTransition>` components are in the tree. A bare `viewTransitionName` style is for isolating elements from a parent's snapshot, not for triggering animations.
- **`update` trigger for same-route navigations** — nested VTs inside the content steal the mutation from the parent, so `update` never fires on the outer VT. Use `key` + `name` + `share` instead.
- **Named VT in a reusable component** — if a component with a named VT is rendered in both a modal/popover *and* a page, both mount simultaneously and break the morph. Make the name conditional or move it to the specific consumer.
- **`router.back()` for back navigation** — React renders `popstate`-scheduled transitions synchronously (skipping view transitions), and traversals carry no transition types. Use `router.push()` with an explicit URL.

# Patterns and Guidelines

## Searchable Grid with `useDeferredValue`

`useDeferredValue` makes filter updates a transition, activating `<ViewTransition>`:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useDeferredValue, useState, ViewTransition, Suspense } from 'react';

export default function SearchableGrid({ itemsPromise }) {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
  const deferredSearch = useDeferredValue(search);

  return (
    <>
      <input value={search} onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.currentTarget.value)} />
      <ViewTransition>
        <Suspense fallback={<GridSkeleton />}>
          <ItemGrid itemsPromise={itemsPromise} search={deferredSearch} />
        </Suspense>
      </ViewTransition>
    </>
  );
}
```

Per-item `<ViewTransition name={...}>` inside a deferred list triggers cross-fades on every keystroke. Fix with `default="none"`:

```tsx
{filteredItems.map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id} name={`item-${item.id}`} share="morph" default="none">
    <ItemCard item={item} />
  </ViewTransition>
))}
```

## Card Expand/Collapse with `startTransition`

Toggle between grid and detail view with shared element morph:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState, useRef, startTransition, ViewTransition } from 'react';

export default function ItemGrid({ items }) {
  const [expandedId, setExpandedId] = useState(null);
  const scrollRef = useRef(0);

  return expandedId ? (
    <ViewTransition enter="slide-in" name={`item-${expandedId}`}>
      <ItemDetail
        item={items.find(i => i.id === expandedId)}
        onClose={() => {
          startTransition(() => {
            setExpandedId(null);
            setTimeout(() => window.scrollTo({ behavior: 'smooth', top: scrollRef.current }), 100);
          });
        }}
      />
    </ViewTransition>
  ) : (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {items.map(item => (
        <ViewTransition key={item.id} name={`item-${item.id}`}>
          <ItemCard
            item={item}
            onSelect={() => {
              scrollRef.current = window.scrollY;
              startTransition(() => setExpandedId(item.id));
            }}
          />
        </ViewTransition>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Type-Safe Transition Helpers

Use `as const` arrays and derived types to prevent ID clashes:

```tsx
const transitionTypes = ['default', 'transition-to-detail', 'transition-to-list'] as const;
const animationTypes = ['auto', 'none', 'animate-slide-from-left', 'animate-slide-from-right'] as const;

type TransitionType = (typeof transitionTypes)[number];
type AnimationType = (typeof animationTypes)[number];
type TransitionMap = { default: AnimationType } & Partial<Record<Exclude<TransitionType, 'default'>, AnimationType>>;

export function HorizontalTransition({ children, enter, exit }: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  enter: TransitionMap;
  exit: TransitionMap;
}) {
  return <ViewTransition enter={enter} exit={exit}>{children}</ViewTransition>;
}
```

## Cross-Fade Without Remount

Omit `key` to trigger an update (cross-fade) instead of exit + enter. Avoids Suspense remount/refetch:

```jsx
<ViewTransition>
  <TabPanel tab={activeTab} />
</ViewTransition>
```

Use `key` when content identity changes (state resets). Omit for cross-fades (tabs, panels, carousel).

## Isolate Elements from Parent Animations

Pull an element out of the animated `root` snapshot by giving it its own `view-transition-name`. **`view-transition-name: none` is a no-op** — it's the CSS default, so the element stays in `root` (a common flicker bug). Use a real, unique name, then neutralize with `<ViewTransition default="none">` (no CSS) or CSS (needed for `z-index`/`display` control — see the CSS Animation Recipes section).

- **Persistent chrome** (nav, sidebar, player bar): `<nav style={{ viewTransitionName: 'persistent-nav' }}>` + isolation CSS. `<ViewTransition default="none">` works too, but its auto-name can't take `z-index`/backdrop `display:none` — hand-name when you need those.
- **Floating elements** (popovers, menus): left open, they're captured in `root` and flicker on settle. Real name + isolation (the CSS Animation Recipes section → Floating Element Isolation). A static name is fine if only one is mounted (`unmountOnHide`); native top-layer (`popover`/`<dialog>`) settle-flicker is a browser limit.
- **Naming an interactive element has a cost:** named participants are skipped by hit-testing while a transition runs — hover, cursor, and clicks fall through to whatever is beneath for the transition's duration (spec behavior; [csswg#10930](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10930)). Always **portal** a named popover/menu so those fallback hits stay inside its own subtree: rendered inline in a clickable row, mid-transition clicks hover/activate the row behind it, and outside-click detection closes the popover.

## Suspense reveal flicker

An element rendered in **both** the fallback and the content flickers (opacity dip) on reveal — it fades against itself. Not a morph. **Fix: render it outside the `<Suspense>` boundary** (mount once, above it), or pin it with a `view-transition-name`.

```jsx
<h1>{title}</h1>
<Suspense fallback={<BodySkeleton />}><Body /></Suspense>
```

Don't put a manual `viewTransitionName` on the root DOM node inside `<ViewTransition>` — React's auto-name overrides it.

## Sliding Indicator (tabs)

One shared-name indicator rendered under the **active** tab morphs between positions on change (slide the group, disable old/new — see the CSS Animation Recipes section → Sliding Indicator). Render it only under the active tab so exactly one element holds `indicatorName`; use a distinct `indicatorName` per tab strip. Trigger the state change inside `startTransition` so the move animates. Whatever owns `active` drives it — local state here, routing in Next (see the View Transitions in Next.js section → Routing-Driven Tabs).

```tsx
import { useState, useTransition, ViewTransition } from 'react';

export function Tabs({ tabs, indicatorName = 'tab-indicator' }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(tabs[0].value);
  const [, startTransition] = useTransition();
  return (
    <nav>
      {tabs.map(t => (
        <button key={t.value} type="button"
          aria-current={active === t.value ? 'page' : undefined}
          onClick={() => startTransition(() => setActive(t.value))}>
          <span>{t.label}</span>
          {active === t.value && (
            <ViewTransition name={indicatorName} share="tab-underline">
              <span className="active-underline" aria-hidden />
            </ViewTransition>
          )}
        </button>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

Because the state change is a transition, if the newly-active tab renders suspending content the whole update — indicator **and** `aria-current` — waits for it to commit, and the strip feels dead on click. Give the controls an immediate value with `useOptimistic` (drive `aria-current` from it) so feedback is instant while the content streams. The routing variant (the View Transitions in Next.js section → Routing-Driven Tabs) does exactly this: optimistic `aria-current`, committed `active` for the bar.

## Layout Displacement Morph

Only content inside an activated boundary animates position — everything else teleports to its new layout spot. When a list grows or shrinks, wrap the sibling content below it so it glides instead of jumping:

```jsx
<FavoritesList />              {/* rows enter/exit */}
<ViewTransition>               {/* bare: update enabled */}
  <section>
    <h2>You Might Also Like</h2>
    <Recommendations />
  </section>
</ViewTransition>
```

The section — heading included — morphs as one group when rows above are added or removed. Nothing inside the section changed; the *displacement* is the update.

- React activates VT boundaries that are direct children (not behind an intermediate DOM node) of nodes along the changed path — siblings of the mutation and of its ancestors qualify; a VT buried under an extra wrapper element in a sibling does not (deliberate: page-wide re-layout would otherwise fire noisy animations everywhere). Place the boundary as a direct sibling of the changing content.
- `default="none"` disables exactly this morph — it turns off `update`. Named/shared elements get `default="none"`; displaced siblings and keyed list items stay bare or set `update="auto"`.

## Reusable Animated Collapse

```jsx
function AnimatedCollapse({ open, children }) {
  if (!open) return null;
  return (
    <ViewTransition enter="expand-in" exit="collapse-out">
      {children}
    </ViewTransition>
  );
}

// Usage: toggle with startTransition
<button onClick={() => startTransition(() => setOpen(o => !o))}>Toggle</button>
<AnimatedCollapse open={open}><SectionContent /></AnimatedCollapse>
```

## Composing with Activity

`Activity` is orthogonal to view transitions: it preserves the state of a hidden subtree, `ViewTransition` animates it. Compose them for an in-page show/hide (drawer, panel, tab body) that keeps its scroll/form state while it animates in and out:

```jsx
<Activity mode={isVisible ? 'visible' : 'hidden'}>
  <ViewTransition enter="slide-in" exit="slide-out">
    <Sidebar />
  </ViewTransition>
</Activity>
```

Only reach for Activity when there's state worth preserving — a stateless element (e.g. the sliding indicator above) gains nothing from it. In Next.js, layout-hosted chrome already persists across navigations without Activity (see the View Transitions in Next.js section).

## Exclude Elements with `useOptimistic`

`useOptimistic` values update before the transition snapshot, excluding them from animation. Use for controls (labels); use committed state for animated content:

```tsx
const [sort, setSort] = useState('newest');
const [optimisticSort, setOptimisticSort] = useOptimistic(sort);

function cycleSort() {
  const nextSort = getNextSort(optimisticSort);
  startTransition(() => {
    setOptimisticSort(nextSort);  // before snapshot — no animation
    setSort(nextSort);            // between snapshots — animates
  });
}

<button>Sort: {LABELS[optimisticSort]}</button>
{items.sort(comparators[sort]).map(item => (
  <ViewTransition key={item.id}><ItemCard item={item} /></ViewTransition>
))}
```

---

## View Transition Events

Imperative control via `onEnter`, `onExit`, `onUpdate`, `onShare`. Return a cleanup function to cancel your animation when the transition finishes. `onShare` takes precedence over `onEnter`/`onExit`.

```jsx
<ViewTransition
  onEnter={(instance, types) => {
    const anim = instance.new.animate(
      [{ transform: 'scale(0.8)', opacity: 0 }, { transform: 'scale(1)', opacity: 1 }],
      { duration: 300, easing: 'ease-out' }
    );
    return () => anim.cancel();
  }}
>
  <Component />
</ViewTransition>
```

The `instance` object: `instance.old`, `instance.new`, `instance.group`, `instance.imagePair`, `instance.name`.

The `types` array (second argument) lets you vary animation based on transition type.

---

## Animation Timing

| Interaction | Duration |
|------------|----------|
| Direct toggle (expand/collapse) | 100–200ms |
| Route transition (slide) | 150–250ms |
| Suspense reveal (skeleton → content) | 200–400ms |
| Shared element morph | 300–500ms |

---

## Troubleshooting

**VT not activating:** Ensure `<ViewTransition>` comes before any DOM node. Ensure state update is inside `startTransition`.

**"Two ViewTransition components with the same name":** Names must be globally unique. Use IDs: `name={`hero-${item.id}`}`.

**Scrolling hangs while a transition animates:** the `::view-transition` overlay is `position: fixed` and its snapshots don't scroll — a browser limitation, not fixable in React (skipping snaps to the end). Keep reveal durations short; for scroll-driven UI use gesture transitions (experimental `useSwipeTransition`, if available).

**Open popover flickers when a background transition settles:** it's captured in `root`. Give it a real `view-transition-name` + isolation (not `none`) — see "Floating Elements".

**Popover closes or goes dead when clicked mid-transition:** named participants are skipped by hit-testing while a transition runs; clicks land on what's beneath and read as outside-clicks. Portal the popover (see "Isolate Elements from Parent Animations"); brief dead clicks during the transition remain — that's the price of the name.

**Shared morph silently not firing:** `share` resolved to `none`. Either the VT has `default="none"` with no explicit `share` prop, or `share` is type-keyed and the navigation never adds the type — the link needs `transitionTypes` (or `addTransitionType` in the transition).

**Section below a list teleports instead of gliding:** it's outside any activated boundary, its VT has `default="none"` (which disables `update`), or it isn't an immediate sibling of the changing content. See "Layout Displacement Morph" above.

**`router.back()` and browser back/forward skip animation:** React renders `popstate`-scheduled transitions synchronously (skipping view transitions), and traversals carry no transition types. Use `router.push()` with an explicit URL instead. See SKILL.md "router.back() and Browser Back Button."

**`flushSync` skips animations:** Use `startTransition` instead.

**Only updates animate (no enter/exit):** Without `<Suspense>`, React treats swaps as updates. Conditionally render the VT itself, or wrap in `<Suspense>`.

**Layout VT prevents page VTs from animating:** nested VTs don't fire their own enter/exit when they mount/unmount *as one unit* with a parent VT — only the outermost animates. (A child VT swapped inside a persistent parent fires normally; if page enter/exit is dead under a persistent layout VT, check the page VT isn't below a plain DOM node instead.) If your layout has a VT wrapping `{children}`, remove it and put VTs in pages.

**List reorder not animating with `useOptimistic`:** Optimistic values resolve before snapshot. Use committed state for list order.

**TS error "Property 'default' is missing":** Type-keyed objects require a `default` key.

**Hash fragments cause scroll jumps:** Navigate without hash; scroll programmatically after navigation.

**Backdrop-blur flickers:** Use the backdrop-blur workaround from the CSS Animation Recipes section.

**`border-radius` lost during transitions:** Apply `border-radius` directly to the captured element.

**Skeleton controls slide away:** Give matching controls the same `viewTransitionName`.

**Batching:** Multiple updates during animation are batched. A→B→C→D becomes B→D.

:root {
  --duration-exit: 150ms;
  --duration-enter: 210ms;
  --duration-move: 400ms;
}
```

### Shared Keyframes

```css
@keyframes fade {
  from { filter: blur(3px); opacity: 0; }
  to { filter: blur(0); opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes slide {
  from { translate: var(--slide-offset); }
  to { translate: 0; }
}

@keyframes slide-y {
  from { transform: translateY(var(--slide-y-offset, 10px)); }
  to { transform: translateY(0); }
}
```

---

## Fade

```css
::view-transition-old(.fade-out) {
  animation: var(--duration-exit) ease-in fade reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.fade-in) {
  animation: var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade;
}
```

Usage: `<ViewTransition enter="fade-in" exit="fade-out" />`

---

## Slide (Vertical)

```css
::view-transition-old(.slide-down) {
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-out both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-exit) ease-out both slide-y reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.slide-up) {
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-in var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in both slide-y;
}
```

Usage:
```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<ViewTransition exit="slide-down"><Skeleton /></ViewTransition>}>
  <ViewTransition default="none" enter="slide-up"><Content /></ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

---

## Directional Navigation

### Separate Enter/Exit Classes

```css
::view-transition-new(.slide-from-right) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}
::view-transition-old(.slide-to-left) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}

::view-transition-new(.slide-from-left) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}
::view-transition-old(.slide-to-right) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}
```

### Single-Class Approach

```css
::view-transition-old(.nav-forward) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.nav-forward) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}

::view-transition-old(.nav-back) {
  --slide-offset: 60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-exit) ease-in both fade reverse,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide reverse;
}
::view-transition-new(.nav-back) {
  --slide-offset: -60px;
  animation:
    var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both fade,
    var(--duration-move) ease-in-out both slide;
}
```

---

## Shared Element Morph

```css
::view-transition-group(.morph) {
  animation-duration: var(--duration-move);
}

::view-transition-image-pair(.morph) {
  animation-name: via-blur;
}

@keyframes via-blur {
  30% { filter: blur(3px); }
}
```

Usage: `<ViewTransition name={`product-${id}`} share="morph" />`

**Note:** Shared element transitions take raster snapshots. For text with significant size differences (e.g., `<h3>` → `<h1>`), the old snapshot gets scaled up, producing a visible ghost artifact. Use `text-morph` for text shared elements.

## Text Morph

Avoids raster scaling artifacts on text by hiding the old snapshot and showing the new text at full resolution:

```css
::view-transition-group(.text-morph) {
  animation-duration: var(--duration-move);
}
::view-transition-old(.text-morph) {
  display: none;
}
::view-transition-new(.text-morph) {
  animation: none;
  object-fit: none;
  object-position: left top;
}
```

Usage: `<ViewTransition name={`title-${id}`} share="text-morph" />`

---

## Scale

```css
::view-transition-old(.scale-out) {
  animation: var(--duration-exit) ease-in scale-down;
}
::view-transition-new(.scale-in) {
  animation: var(--duration-enter) ease-out var(--duration-exit) both scale-up;
}

@keyframes scale-down {
  from { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
  to { transform: scale(0.85); opacity: 0; }
}
@keyframes scale-up {
  from { transform: scale(0.85); opacity: 0; }
  to { transform: scale(1); opacity: 1; }
}
```

Usage: `<ViewTransition enter="scale-in" exit="scale-out" />`

---

## Interactivity During Transitions

The `::view-transition` overlay covers the viewport and captures all pointer events by default. React partially handles this: when the root group doesn't need to animate, it shrinks the overlay to zero size so the page stays interactive — but it deliberately leaves `pointer-events` alone so in-flight animations still block clicks (so they don't land on whatever is beneath a moving snapshot). To let clicks and hover pass through even while animations run:

```css
::view-transition {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

Trade-off: clicks during an animation can now hit live elements underneath still-moving snapshots. And it only restores interactivity for **unnamed** content — elements participating in the transition (anything with a `view-transition-name`) are skipped by hit-testing for the transition's duration, spec behavior with no CSS override ([csswg#10930](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10930)). Weigh that cost before naming interactive elements, and portal named popovers (see the Patterns and Guidelines section → Isolate Elements from Parent Animations).

---

## Persistent Element Isolation

```css
::view-transition-group(persistent-nav) {
  animation: none;
  z-index: 100;
}
```

### Backdrop-Blur Workaround

For elements with `backdrop-filter`, hide the old snapshot to avoid flash:

```css
::view-transition-old(persistent-nav) {
  display: none;
}
::view-transition-new(persistent-nav) {
  animation: none;
}
```

### Floating Element Isolation (popovers, menus, tooltips, control clusters)

Same freeze as persistent chrome. A floating/interactive element left rendered while a background transition runs is otherwise captured in the `root` snapshot and flickers as it settles. Give it a real, unique `view-transition-name` (never `none` — that's the CSS default = no isolation) and:

```css
::view-transition-group(popover) {
  animation: none;
  z-index: 100;
}
::view-transition-old(popover),
::view-transition-new(popover) {
  animation: none;
}
```

### Sliding Indicator (tab underline / segmented pill)

One shared-name indicator morphs between positions. Slide the group; disable old/new so the solid bar slides instead of cross-fading:

```css
::view-transition-group(.tab-underline) {
  animation-duration: 220ms;
  animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
::view-transition-old(.tab-underline),
::view-transition-new(.tab-underline) {
  animation: none;
  height: 100%;
}
```

---

## Reduced Motion

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-old(*),
  ::view-transition-new(*),
  ::view-transition-group(*) {
    animation-duration: 0s !important;
    animation-delay: 0s !important;
  }
}
```

---

# View Transitions in Next.js

## Setup

`<ViewTransition>` works out of the box — the bundled React canary ships it, and every `<Link>` navigation already runs inside `React.startTransition`, so react-dom starts a view transition whenever affected `<ViewTransition>` components exist. The documented flag:

```js
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: { viewTransition: true },
};
module.exports = nextConfig;
```

Historically this switched the bundled React to the experimental channel; in current Next.js (16.2+) it gates nothing at runtime, but set it anyway to match the documented setup. Because every link click is a transition, any VT with `default="auto"` fires on **every** navigation — use `default="none"` to prevent competing animations.

Do **not** install `react@canary` — see "Availability" for details.

---

## Next.js Implementation Additions

When following the Implementation Workflow section, apply these additions:

**After Step 2:** Enable the experimental flag above.

**Step 4:** Use `transitionTypes` on `<Link>` — see "The `transitionTypes` Prop" section below for usage and availability.

**After Step 6:** For same-route dynamic segments (e.g., `/collection/[slug]`), use the `key` + `name` + `share` pattern — see Same-Route Dynamic Segment Transitions below.

---

## Layout-Level ViewTransition

**Do NOT add a layout-level VT wrapping `{children}` if pages have their own VTs.** Nested VTs never fire enter/exit when inside a parent VT — page-level enter/exit will silently not work. Remove the layout VT entirely.

A bare `<ViewTransition>` in layout works only if pages have **no** VTs of their own.

**Layouts persist across navigations** — `enter`/`exit` only fire on initial mount, not on route changes. Don't use type-keyed maps in layouts. Because layouts persist, chrome hosted in one (nav, sidebar, player) keeps its state across navigations for free — no `Activity` needed. Reserve `Activity` for in-page show/hide (see the Patterns and Guidelines section → Composing with Activity).

---

## The `transitionTypes` Prop on `next/link`

No wrapper component needed, works in Server Components:

```tsx
<Link href="/products/1" transitionTypes={['transition-to-detail']}>View Product</Link>
```

Replaces the manual pattern of `onNavigate` + `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` + `router.push()`. Reserve manual `startTransition` for non-link interactions (buttons, forms).

**Availability:** `transitionTypes` shipped in **Next.js 16.2.0** (it is not gated on the `experimental.viewTransition` flag). If unavailable, use `startTransition` + `addTransitionType` + `router.push()` (see Programmatic Navigation below). To check: `grep -r "transitionTypes" node_modules/next/dist/` — if no results, fall back to programmatic navigation.

---

## Programmatic Navigation

```tsx
'use client';

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { startTransition, addTransitionType } from 'react';

function DetailButton({ href }: { href: string }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  function handleNavigate() {
    startTransition(() => {
      addTransitionType('nav-forward');
      router.push(href);
    });
  }

  return <button onClick={handleNavigate}>Open</button>;
}
```

---

## Server-Side Filtering with `router.replace`

For search/sort/filter that re-renders on the server (via URL params), use `startTransition` + `router.replace`. VTs activate because the state update is inside `startTransition`:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { startTransition } from 'react';

function handleSort(sort: string) {
  const router = useRouter();
  startTransition(() => {
    router.replace(`?sort=${sort}`);
  });
}
```

List items wrapped in `<ViewTransition key={item.id}>` will animate reorder. This is the server-component alternative to the client-side `useDeferredValue` pattern in the Patterns and Guidelines section.

---

## Routing-Driven Tabs

The generalized sliding indicator (the Patterns and Guidelines section → Sliding Indicator) driven by navigation instead of local state: tabs are `<Link>`s, `active` comes from the URL (a server prop), and `useOptimistic` slides the indicator instantly while the route commits. Key the mounted indicator to committed `active` so the bar lands where navigation actually settles.

```tsx
'use client';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { useOptimistic, useTransition, ViewTransition } from 'react';

export function Tabs({ tabs, active, indicatorName = 'tab-indicator' }) {
  const [optimisticActive, setOptimisticActive] = useOptimistic(active);
  const [, startTransition] = useTransition();
  return (
    <nav>
      {tabs.map(t => (
        <Link key={t.value} href={t.href} scroll={false}
          aria-current={optimisticActive === t.value ? 'page' : undefined}
          onNavigate={() => startTransition(() => setOptimisticActive(t.value))}>
          <span>{t.label}</span>
          {active === t.value && (
            <ViewTransition name={indicatorName} share="tab-underline">
              <span className="active-underline" aria-hidden />
            </ViewTransition>
          )}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

---

## Two-Layer Pattern (Directional + Suspense)

Directional slides + Suspense reveals coexist because they fire at different moments. Place the directional VT in the **page component** (not layout):

```tsx
<ViewTransition
  enter={{ "nav-forward": "slide-from-right", default: "none" }}
  exit={{ "nav-forward": "slide-to-left", default: "none" }}
  default="none"
>
  <div>
    <Suspense fallback={<ViewTransition exit="slide-down"><Skeleton /></ViewTransition>}>
      <ViewTransition enter="slide-up" default="none"><Content /></ViewTransition>
    </Suspense>
  </div>
</ViewTransition>
```

---

## `loading.tsx` as Suspense Boundary

Next.js `loading.tsx` is an implicit `<Suspense>` boundary. Wrap the skeleton in `<ViewTransition exit="...">` in `loading.tsx`, and the content in `<ViewTransition enter="..." default="none">` in the page:

```tsx
// loading.tsx
<ViewTransition exit="slide-down"><PhotoGridSkeleton /></ViewTransition>

// page.tsx
<ViewTransition enter="slide-up" default="none"><PhotoGrid photos={photos} /></ViewTransition>
```

Same rules as explicit `<Suspense>`: use simple string props (not type maps) since Suspense reveals fire without transition types.

---

## Shared Elements Across Routes

```tsx
// List page
{products.map((product) => (
  <Link key={product.id} href={`/products/${product.id}`} transitionTypes={['nav-forward']}>
    <ViewTransition name={`product-${product.id}`}>
      <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} width={400} height={300} />
    </ViewTransition>
  </Link>
))}

// Detail page — same name
<ViewTransition name={`product-${product.id}`}>
  <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} width={800} height={600} />
</ViewTransition>
```

If the pair's `share` is type-keyed (or classed via CSS that expects a type), every `<Link>` between the two views must carry the type via `transitionTypes` — a plain link click resolves the share map's `default`, and if that's `none` the morph silently never fires.

---

## Same-Route Dynamic Segment Transitions

When navigating between dynamic segments of the same route (e.g., `/collection/[slug]`), the router swaps subtrees keyed by the segment value (or re-shows Activity-cached ones) rather than doing a plain unmount/mount — so enter/exit don't fire reliably. Use `key` + `name` + `share`:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
  <ViewTransition key={slug} name={`collection-${slug}`} share="auto" default="none">
    <Content slug={slug} />
  </ViewTransition>
</Suspense>
```

- `key={slug}` forces unmount/remount on change
- `name` + `share="auto"` creates a shared element crossfade
- VT inside `<Suspense>` (without keying Suspense) keeps old content visible during loading

## Nested enter/exit — `parentEnter` / `parentExit` (experimental)

Lifts the "nested VTs don't fire enter/exit inside a parent" rule: a nested VT can animate when its **parent** enters/exits (`parentEnter`/`parentExit`, `onParentEnter`/`onParentExit`; `parentEnter="none"` stops propagation). Experimental-channel only today (behind `enableViewTransitionParentEnterExit = __EXPERIMENTAL__`); SSR support for Suspense reveals landed in React PR #36917 ([commit](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/83840902c890f0eb85decda239ef6b1b14945779)). Verify it's in the React your app actually runs: `grep -c "parentEnter" node_modules/next/dist/compiled/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js` — 0 means unavailable (Next only uses the experimental channel when flags like `blockingSSR`/`taint` are set).

## Server Components

- `<ViewTransition>` works in both Server and Client Components
- `<Link transitionTypes>` works in Server Components — no `'use client'` needed
- `addTransitionType` and `startTransition` for programmatic nav require Client Components
